## Tier Selection

**Tier:** Tier 1

**Justification:** We wanted to tackle a small and common problem and do it well rather than failing to execute a complicated higher tier problem.

## Problem Statement

People often forget what's in their fridge, leading to costly food waste and duplicate purchases that particularly affect busy families and sustainability advocates. This is a significant issue, as U.S. households waste up to $2,913 annually on spoiled food, but solving it would save money, reduce environmental impact, and streamline grocery planning.

## Solution Overview

[Your 2-3 sentence solution overview goes here. Briefly describe your proposed solution.]

## Technical Approach

[Describe your planned technical approach. What techniques, models, or frameworks will you use? (e.g., "We will use a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification..." or "We will build a CNN using PyTorch...")]

## Dataset Plan

- **Source:** [Where will you get the data? e.g., Kaggle, web scraping, public API]
- **Size:** [What is the estimated size? e.g., ~10,000 images, 2GB of text data]
- **Labels:** [What are the target labels? e.g., Bounding boxes, sentiment (positive/negative), etc.]
- **Link:** [Link to the dataset if it is public]

## Metrics

- **Primary Metric:** [The main metric you will use to evaluate success, e.g., mAP, F1-Score, Accuracy]
- **Secondary Metric:** [Other metrics to track, e.g., Inference Time, Model Size, Precision]

## Week-by-Week Plan

| 15 (Dec 4)  | Present project                 | ðŸŽ‰ Presentation day |

## Resources Needed

[List the compute, potential costs, or specific APIs you will need. e.g., "Google Colab Pro for GPU access", "OpenAI API key", "AWS S3 bucket for storage"]

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk               | Probability       | Mitigation                                                         |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low accuracy       | Medium            | Use data augmentation and experiment with different architectures. |
| Missing data       | High              | Switch to Roboflow dataset or another public alternative.          |
| [Add another risk] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Your mitigation plan]                                             |
