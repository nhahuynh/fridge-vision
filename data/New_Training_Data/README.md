# 🍎 Fruit Image Dataset – New Training Data

This folder contains the custom fruit images used for the Computer Vision assignment.  
Each subfolder represents one fruit class, and all images inside belong to that category.

The dataset is organized so it can be used directly for:
- Image classification  
- Model training and testing  
- Data augmentation practice  
- YOLO or CNN-based computer vision projects

## ✔️ Notes
