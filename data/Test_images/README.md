# 🧪 Test Images – Fridge Vision Project

This folder contains **unlabeled test images** used to evaluate the fruit-classification and object-detection models developed for the Fridge Vision assignment.

These images are *not* part of the training dataset.  
They are used only for:

- Model accuracy testing  
- Generalisation evaluation  
- Testing how the model performs on real, unseen household items

## 📂 Folder Contents

The folder includes a variety of food-related items such as:

| File Example                | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Apple.png**              | Whole red apple |
| **Apple_1.png**, **Apple_2.png** | Additional apple test images |
| **Bravo Orange juice.png** | Juice bottle (useful for testing false positives) |
| **Kiwi001005.png**, **Kiwi001009.png** | Kiwi fruit samples |
| **Mango001.png**           | Mango test sample |
| **Peach001010.png**        | Peach image |
| **Orange00100.png**        | Orange image |
| **Milk.png**               | Milk carton (non-fruit item) |
| **Red_Grapefruit.png**     | Grapefruit image |

These images help check whether the model:

- Correctly identifies fruit  
- Misclassifies packaged items  
- Handles lighting + angle variations  
- Detects fruit that wasn’t shown in training

## 🧠 Purpose of This Test Set

This test set is designed to evaluate:

- Classification accuracy  
- Model robustness  
- Ability to generalize to real household fridge items  
- Ability to distinguish fruit vs non-fruit objects  
- Potential need for retraining or adding new classes
